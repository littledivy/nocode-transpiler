# No Code Transpiler

Turn any source code into nocode.

## Getting Started

Start by cloning your favorite repo.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:torvalds/linux.git
```

Now run the transpiler over the repo.

```sh
elixir Transpiler.exs linux
# You can now uninstall elixir
```

Tada! All of the source is now transpiled into nocode. You can now easily mantain a nocode port of your repository! 

And of course, it is production ready (even if it wasn't earlier).
